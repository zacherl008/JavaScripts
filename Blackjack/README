A program to simulate a game of Blackjack. Features a dealer that will ask how many players, the name of the players, and then deal them their hands and ask if they wish to hit or stand. Contains a deck of 52 card objects that each contain a rank and suit, representing a standard deck of cards, which are shuffled prior to each hand. Contains features such as: automatically deciding an ace as a one or eleven based on the players hand and then dynamically adjusting as more cards are added, checking for a natural blackjack and a Five Card Charlie, and playing subsequent hands based on player input.
